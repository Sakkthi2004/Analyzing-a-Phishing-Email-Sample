# Analyzing-a-Phishing-Email-Sample

By analyzing a phishing email sample I had learnt about email spoofing and about the workflow of a phishing tool.
 * I had checked the email header by Messegeheader website from my own spam emails whether it is a phishing mail or normal mail.
 * I had searched for a sample phishing mail from online and I found some old scam emails then some phishing emails too from so may websites like cyberpilot, caniphish, etc,.
 * I uploaded an example email in this repository.
